                <h1 class="title">The Problem</h1>
                <p> 
                    The United States wasted 72 Billion Pounds of food each year. According to the USDA 34 million people including 9 million children live with food insecurity within the United states. This is completely unacceptable. You as an American citizen may be thinking well which businesses waste the most food and if there's one business that produces the most waste how should we go about changing how they waste food? In this article we will look at a small sample size of food waste within brooklyn you can freely explore the data and come to your own conclusions. The purpose of these visualizations was to inform you about food waste and to what degree and extent does fresh produce that could feed starving children go to waste?

                <h1 class="subtitle">When is Bad food Bad?</h1>
                <p>Here at the barchart we can see how far each food item was away from expiration and to what extent was that given section of food thrown away. Obviously food that has expired weeks ago should be thrown away as well as food items that have expired for days according to the manufacturer. Of Course shops have to throw away food that only has one day before it expires as well! Well… not exactly. These dates were taken from the difference between the day the item was collected to the “use by” or “sell by” date. These dates are NOT for determining spoilage. They are an estimation of when product quality might deteriorate. Food items that are past their expiration date can stay good when frozen for MONTHS!. But the most pressing is that a “use by” date has been used by consumers as an expiration date. Thus many markets and shops toss goods that are near or slightly past this date. This is unacceptable as, even non shelf stable food items can stay good for days before truly seeing a change in product quality. Thus we must consider that these food items, although unappealing, are perfectly good to consume or at the very least should be given to a shelter and people within the grips of food insecurity. Thus these food items should not be thrown away, they should be consumed or at the very least go to some kind of food bank.</p>

                <h1 class="subtitle">Why Perfectly Fresh Food Is Thrown Away?</h1>
                <p>Another alarming point is the amount of food that would stay good for days,weeks,months, or over a year! This is likely due to another problem with how we treat food. If an item is dented or if a certain food does look good like a misshapen tomato. These will also be tossed despite them being perfectly good. This not only contributes to the food waste crises but essentially takes food away from starving children.</p>

                <h1 class="subtitle">Transition</h1>
                <p>To get a better picture of what is truly good to each i made a pie chart demonstrate which percentages of certain food items are thrown away and what percentage of that waste was perfectly good food knowing what you know now</p>

                <p>Use the pie chart above to cycle through the differing businesses than click on this pie chart to see aproximately how much food woulve been perfectly fine to consume</p>

            <div class="box m-6">
                <h1 class="subtitle">How much food within their use by date did they throw away?</h1>
                <p>Here you can see a percentage representation of the barchart above but in pie form. Here you can click on the chart and see how much food that was at or before their sell by date was thrown away. This chart is also controlled by the pie chart above and I encourage you to cycle through the differing businesses in this case as well. If you've selected all locations and click on this pie chart you will see that over 60% of the food that was thrown away were not even past their expiration date. This is a crazy number but it also gives you more perspective. Although bakeries and delis throw away 20% of all the food recovered, we now know that almost 70% of these items had been expired for a number of days. This also lets us know that not only do drug stores throw away the most food, in this example an overwhelming majority of what they throw away is perfectly good, over 80%!. This means that we might need to take some kind of action against drug stores within brooklyn and figure out a way to prevent the immense waste they produce

                <h1 class="subtitle">Conclusions</h1>
                <p>Looking at the last visualization we can see the total amount of dollars lost in food. Which comes to 940 dollars. Think about this number: what could you do with 940 dollars?  We must take action against food waste within our country if not for ourselves than at least for the 9 million children in the US that are constantly going hungary.
