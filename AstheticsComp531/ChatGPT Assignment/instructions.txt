Given a random starting position, between -30 and 30 in the X and or Y 
position draw overlapping squares that will:
1. change hue when moving left
2. change saturation when moving up
3. change lightness when moving down
4. change saturation when moving right

New instructions:
Given a randomly selected hue at the beginning, starting at the middle of the canvas
randomly change the position of each sqaure by changing its direction with each plot
of their position change their satuation and lightness by thier current position
changes in X will change lightness while the Y will control saturation
